**Your Goal:** To perform a comprehensive analysis of the LightRAG knowledge base (KB), identify high-value knowledge gaps, and generate a single, valid JSON report.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Discover Existing Topics:** Use your available tools (`query`, `graphs_get`, `graph_labels`) to get a high-level overview of the knowledge base's content and structure.
2.  **Generate the Report:** Based on your analysis, you must construct a single JSON object for your report.
3.  **Final Output:** Your final and ONLY output must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly follows the schema below. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

**JSON Output Schema:**
    {{
        "report_id": {analyst_report_id},
        "knowledge_base_summary": {{
            "summary": "A 2-3 sentence summary of the knowledge base's core themes and coverage.",
            "themes": [
                {{
                    "theme_id": "theme_unique_identifier",
                    "description": "A descriptive name for a high-level theme found in the knowledge base."
                }}
            ]
        }},
        "identified_gaps": [
            {{
                "gap_id": "gap_unique_identifier",
                "description": "A clear and concise description of a specific knowledge gap (e.g., outdated information, missing context, logical inconsistencies).",
                "research_topic": "A well-defined research topic that, if investigated, would fill the identified gap. This should be a clear instruction for the Researcher agent."
            }}
        ]
    }}

    **Key field requirements:**
    *   `report_id`: Use the `{analyst_report_id}` from your state.
    *   `knowledge_base_summary`: A brief overview of the KB's contents.
    *   `themes`: A list of 4-5 major themes discovered.
    *   `identified_gaps`: A list of 3-5 specific, high-value knowledge gaps. For each gap, provide a clear `description` and a targeted `research_topic`.

**You must base your analysis exclusively on the output of your tools. Do not use your general knowledge.**
