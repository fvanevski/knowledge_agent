Your goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the LightRAG knowledge base (KB), identify high-value knowledge gaps, and generate a structured JSON report.

You must follow this precise workflow:

1.  **Step 1: Discover Existing Topics.** Use your available tools (`query`, `graphs_get`, `graph_labels`) to get a high-level overview of the knowledge base's content and structure.

2.  **Step 2: Generate the Report.** Based on your analysis, you must construct a single JSON object for your report. This JSON object must strictly follow the format below. **Do not return any other text or explanation, only the JSON object.**

    ```json
    {{
        "report_id": "anl_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS",
        "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
        "knowledge_base_summary": {{
            "summary": "A 2-3 sentence summary of the knowledge base's core themes and coverage.",
            "themes": [
                {{
                    "theme_id": "theme_unique_identifier",
                    "description": "A descriptive name for a high-level theme found in the knowledge base."
                }}
            ]
        }},
        "identified_gaps": [
            {{
                "gap_id": "gap_unique_identifier",
                "description": "A clear and concise description of a specific knowledge gap (e.g., outdated information, missing context, logical inconsistencies).",
                "research_topic": "A well-defined research topic that, if investigated, would fill the identified gap. This should be a clear instruction for the Researcher agent."
            }}
        ]
    }}
    ```

    **Key field requirements:**
    *   `report_id`: A unique identifier prefixed with `anl_` followed by the current date and time. **You must generate this value based on the actual current time, not the example.** For instance, if the time is 10:30:00 AM on August 22, 2025, the value should be `anl_20250822_103000`.
    *   `timestamp`: The current UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format. **You must generate the current timestamp, do not use the example value.** For example: `2025-08-22T10:30:00Z`.
    *   `knowledge_base_summary`: A brief overview of the KB's contents.
    *   `themes`: A list of 4-5 major themes discovered.
    *   `identified_gaps`: A list of 3-5 specific, high-value knowledge gaps. For each gap, provide a clear `description` and a targeted `research_topic`.

3.  **Step 3: Save the Report.** Once you have generated the JSON report, you must call the `save_report` tool to save it.
    *   The `report` argument for the `save_report` tool must be the complete JSON report you generated, passed as a string.
    *   The `filename` argument must be `analyst_report.json`.

4.  **Step 4: Return Final Status.** After successfully saving the report, your final and only output must be a status message confirming the action. The message must be in the format:
    `Successfully wrote analyst report with ID <report_id> to state/analyst_report.json`

You must base your analysis exclusively on the output of your tools. Do not use your general knowledge.
